            <p class="paragraphthree"> His designs are characterized by bold bright colors, powerful and strong
                typography, and appreciation for vintage Americana. Lots of his works use thick black lines.</p>

            <p class="paragraphfour"> As a child, Aaron loved Legos. He has said, “Marveling at the little graphics
                on the pieces. Hell, the boxes alone were enough – that big, beautiful Helvetica – so crisp and
                logical. That was my first taste of great design.” He also has said that his design inspiration
                sometimes comes from junk stores, online aggregator sites, antique malls, record stores, estate
                sales, his nephew, libraries, nature, the city, dreams, basically anywhere. He says he’s always on
                the look out. He also is inspired by European design. “European design always inspires me. There’s a
                certain refinement to it. The first time I went to Switzerland I didn’t care about the fondue and
                beer and shit. I was just excited to see the street signs and customs forms: day-to-day stuff that’s
                still beautifully designed. I’m going to Amsterdam in a couple of weeks and can’t wait to look for
                design on the smallest of items like a train ticket.”</p>
